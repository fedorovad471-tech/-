# Our C++ lessons
*How we work in lessons on C++ programming :*
1. At the beginning of the lesson, we are given a **theory**.
2. Next, together we **discuss** some suggestive lesson tasks.
3. After that, we **solve** the tasks from the contest on our own.
4. And of course, we practice and **solve** tasks **at home**.
      - Write codes
      - Do our contests
